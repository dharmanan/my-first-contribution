# Welcome to My First Contribution!

This project is designed to help you make your first open-source contributions and earn the **"Pull Shark" (🦈)** achievement!

I will guide you through the **two Pull Requests (PRs)** needed to earn this badge.

---

## Task 1: Add Your Name (Your First PR)

Your first task is to add your name to my `contributors` list. This is **PR 1 of 2** required for the badge.

**Step-by-step guide:**

1.  **Click the "Task 1" button below** - This will take you to GitHub where you can create a new file in the `contributors` folder (you won't need to clone or set up anything!).

2.  **In the "Name your file" box**, replace `YOUR_USERNAME.md` with your GitHub username followed by `.md` 
    - Example: If your username is `john_doe`, type `john_doe.md`
    - If your username is `dharmanan`, type `dharmanan.md`

3.  **In the large text area**, write a simple introduction about yourself
    - Example: `Hi, I'm John Doe from Canada!`
    - Or: `Hi, I'm Sarah from the United States!`
    - Feel free to add your location, interests, or anything you'd like to share!
    - Just click green button commit changes    

4.  **Scroll down and click "Propose new file"**, then on the next page click **"Create pull request"**
    - Don't change anything else - just click the green buttons!

5.  **Wait for me to review and merge your pull request**
    - I'll check your contribution and merge it into the main project
    - This usually takes a few hours, but I'll get to it as soon as I can
    - Once merged, your name and avatar will automatically appear on this page!

👇 **Click This Button for Task 1** 👇

## Task 2: Add Your Profile (Your Second PR)

This is your second and final task! After this PR is merged, you will have earned the badge.

**Step-by-step guide:**

1.  **Wait for your Task 1 PR to be merged first** - Once I merge your first contribution, you'll see your name appear on this page. Then you can start Task 2!

2.  **Click the "Task 2" button below** - Just like Task 1, this will open GitHub's file creation page for the `profiles` folder.

3.  **Name the file `YOUR_USERNAME.md`** - Use the same username as before
    - Example: If you used `john_doe.md` in Task 1, use `john_doe.md` here too
    - It's okay to use the same filename because it's in a different folder (`profiles` instead of `contributors`)

4.  **In the text area**, write your GitHub profile link
    - Example: `My GitHub profile: https://github.com/john_doe`
    - Replace `john_doe` with your actual GitHub username
    - Just click green button commit changes   

5.  **Click "Propose new file", then "Create pull request"** - Again, just click the green buttons!

6.  **Wait for me to merge this PR too** - Once this second PR is merged, you will have 2 merged PRs, which will earn you the **"Pull Shark" (🦈)** badge!

👇 **Click This Button for Task 2** 👇

## 🏆 Final Task: Create Your "Trophy" Repo!

Congratulations on completing both tasks! You should now have (or will soon receive) the **"Pull Shark" (�)** badge on your GitHub profile.

It's time to show it off! Let's create a *new* repository on your own profile to celebrate your achievement.

1.  **Click the Button Below.** This will take you to a page to create a new "trophy" repo on your account, using a template I made.

    👇 **Click to Create Your Trophy Repo** 👇

    [![Create Trophy Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Step%203-Create%20Your%20Trophy%20Repo-purple)](https://github.com/dharmanan/my-badge-template/generate)

2.  **On the new page:**
    * Give your new repo a name (like `my-first-github-badge`).
    * Make sure it's **Public**.
    * Click **"Create repository"**.

3.  **You're done!** You now have a new repo on your account with a pre-filled README. You can now edit it to add your name and a screenshot of your actual badge!
