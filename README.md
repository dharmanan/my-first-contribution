# Welcome to My First Contribution!

This project is designed to help you make your very first open-source contribution and earn the **"Open Sourcerer" (🪙)** achievement!

I will guide you through two simple "Pull Requests" (PRs).

---

## Task 1: Add Your Name (Your First PR)

Your first task is to add your name to our `contributors` list.

1.  Click the "Task 1" button below.
2.  Name the file `YOUR_USERNAME.md` (e.g., `dharmanan.md`).
3.  In the text box, write: `Hi, I'm [Your Name]!`
4.  Click "Propose new file", then "Create pull request".
5.  Wait for me to merge it (I'm fast!).

## Task 2 (Bonus): Add Your Profile (Your Second PR)

After your first PR is merged, you can try a second one! This time, you'll add your GitHub profile link to the `profiles` list.

1.  Click the "Task 2" button below.
2.  Name the file `YOUR_USERNAME.md` again (it's in a different folder, so it's okay).
3.  In the text box, write: `My GitHub profile: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME`
4.  Click "Propose new file" and "Create pull request" again.

This will teach you how to make multiple contributions to the same project!
